Let's manage it!
Yup.

172

(Giant) Oh, that's it.
I know a nice place!

173
00:12:04,539 --> 00:12:07,539
You know, it will be fine.

174
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:11,530
Wow ~!
I could make lots of bananas.

175
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,532
But it looks strange.

176
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,535
I wonder if it was also a fire?

177
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,553
I will do it in any way
Do not worry.

178
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:21,553
Well ... That's right.

I'm glad you can return home with this.
Pao ~!

232
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,526
The problem is where the place is.

233
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:03,562
If there is a substance of the star of Pao Pao →

234
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:08,583
The detection unit reads the place
It will deliver it ....

235
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,553
That's it!
The rock where Pao Pao came on?

236
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,606
That's it! Paopao
Near the place I found →

237
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,525
Where is the place where the meteorite fell?

The meteorite?
The rocks here were all bruised.

only this
If it mixes with the earth of the earth →

244
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:35,527
The detection unit can not read it.

You will smoke if you have a nose of Pao Pao.
